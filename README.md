Arduino Console
===============

This project is a simple serial console designed for interaction with an Arduino board via a serial port (usually USB), however it should work for any serial device.

All data is automatically translated into ASCII (or an encoding of your choice) by this console, so binary devices won't work so intuitively.

However, devices can be interfaced in a binary way, which allows hexadecimal data read/write, which works better for binary devices.
